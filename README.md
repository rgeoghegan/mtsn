This is my go implementation of solutions for the famous crypto challenge which I don't want to name by name to avoid easy searching on github.

It currently has the solutions to set 3 to 5, as I'd previously solved set 1 and 2 in python and it bored me to do it again, but I might come back to it.

## How to run

Run

    rake run

for the fast results, which should not take more than like ~5 seconds. If you are a lot more patient, you can do:

    rake runset{3,4,5}_slow

which runs the timing leak challenges which are a lot slower.
